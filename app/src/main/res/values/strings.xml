        COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have
        severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at
        higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

    <string name="how_it_spreads_paragraph">

    It is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets
    produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These <b>droplets</b> can land in the mouths or
    noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. \n \nSpread is more likely
    when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It may be possible
    that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and
    then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be
    the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus. \n \n

    The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people.
    Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more
    efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.
